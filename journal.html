<h1>Miya's Journal</h1>
<h2>10/3/22:
	In the first few' weeks of comp sci, we have learned the basics of coding. In simple terms, the sublime text is set up in a way that's easy for us, as people, to comprehend. There is a head and a body to every code. The same thing applies to the graphical interface on a computer. A "desktop" with "folders" is only there to make it easier for peopple to use, they do not actually exist. I have really enjoyed comp sci so far!!

In comp sci this week, we started decorating our website. I am finding it kind of difficult to make the website appealing to look out. I am struggling to come up with creative ideas for my website. It's suprising to me that the actual coding is easier than the decorating aspect.
