<h1>Miya's Journal</h1>
<h2>10/3/22:
	In the first few weeks of comp sci, we have learned the basics of coding. In simple terms, the sublime text is set up in a way that's easy for us, as people, to comprehend. There is a head and a body to every code. The same thing applies to the graphical interface on a computer. A "desktop" with "folders" is only there to make it easier for peopple to use, they do not actually exist. I have really enjoyed comp sci so far!!
